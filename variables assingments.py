# give five a example data types? 
# 1. **Integer**: 
#    - Represents whole numbers without a fractional component.
#    - Example in Python: `age = 30`
# 2. **Float**: 
#    - Represents real numbers including those with fractional parts.
#    - Example in Python: `temperature = 36.6`
# 3. **String**: 
#    - Used for representing text. It is a sequence of characters.
#    - Example in Python: `name = "Alice"`
# 4. **Boolean**: 
#    - Represents two values: True or False. Used for logical operations.
#    - Example in Python: `is_active = True`
# 5. **List** (in languages like Python) / **Array** (in many other languages):
#    - A collection of elements that can be of the same or different data types. Lists are ordered and changeable.
#    - Example in Python: `colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]`
